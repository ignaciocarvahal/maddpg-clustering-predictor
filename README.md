# Multi-Agent-Deep-Deterministic-Policy-Gradients
A Pytorch implementation of the multi agent deep deterministic policy gradients(MADDPG) algorithm

This is an implementation of the algorithm presented in the paper: Multi Agent Actor Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments applied to an new enviroment that allow predict gmm clustering in differents periods of recopiled data.
